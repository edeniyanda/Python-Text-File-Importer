# Python-Text-File-Importer

This repository contains a script to extract data from a tab-delimited text file and load it into a SQLite database. The script handles data validation and cleaning, and includes a command line interface for specifying input and output files.

# Requirements

1. Python 3

2. sqlite3 library

# Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

python3 Python-Text-File-Importer.py

# Notes

The input file must be a tab-delimited text file with a header row.

The output database file will be created if it does not exist, or overwritten if it does.

Any errors or warnings encountered during the import process will be logged to the console.
